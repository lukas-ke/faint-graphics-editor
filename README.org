* Faint

A cross-platform combined raster and vector graphics editor with
Python scripting support.

Faint is developed in C++ with embedded Python for scripting support.
The wxWidgets framework is used for the graphical user interface,
which means Faint is cross-platform with native look and feel.

The goal is for Faint to be as simple as possible while still having
all the features that are commonly needed for most every-day graphics
editing tasks. Faint supports vector graphics, raster drawing and
sprite-art, animation (frames, gif) and basic photo editing.

Python scripting is available via an interpreter window and script
files. This enables programmatic image editing and configuration.
Functions can be connected to keys, so that they can be called
conveniently while drawing.
