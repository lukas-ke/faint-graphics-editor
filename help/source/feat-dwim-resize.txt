summary:"Expand the image using the surrounding color"

= Do-What-I-Mean Resize =
The DWIM-resize feature uses the old image edge color as background for the new
region after resizing.

== Method ==
After resizing the drawing area (using for example the
\ref(gui-image-resize-handles.txt) or the \ref(gui-resize-dialog.txt)), use
* Python: withbind:dwim();

== Details ==
Normally when expanding the drawing area, the new region is filled
with the secondary color. When the image edges have a distinct color,
it is often more useful to use that color for the new region.

The Resize DWIM feature allows toggling to the old edge color after
resizing. This is more convenient than changing the secondary color
and then resizing, and removes the need to undo after a mistaken
resize.

The color used as the alternative will be the most frequently
appearing color along the old edges.

== Example ==
An image with white background color is resized:
||\image(dwim-resize1.png)||\image(dwim-resize2.png)||

Wrong secondary color, as usual...
||\image(dwim-resize3.png)||

Pressing Alt+Y triggers DWIM-resize, and changes the background color using
the old edge:
||\image(dwim-resize4.png) ||
