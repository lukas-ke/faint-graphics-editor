Canvas objects are used to modify an image opened in
Faint. Modifications to an image through the Canvas interface are
undoable actions, just like the manual image editing.

The active canvas is retrieved with 'get_active_image()'. Specific
canvases can be retrieved from the automatic list 'images' or using
the function 'list_images()'.

Operations on a canvas always target the active frame. To modify a
specific frame, retrieve a \ref(py-frame.txt, frame object) instead
with get_frame(index).

||\image(icon-info.png)|| The undo/redo overhead for each action makes the Canvas interface unsuitable for per-pixel modification. See instead \ref(py-bitmap.txt). ||
