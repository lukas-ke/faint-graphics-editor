= \graphic(tool-selection.png) Selection =
The selection tool is used for selecting raster areas when in the
raster-layer or objects when in the object-layer.

== Raster selection ==
label:tool_raster_selection
When the raster layer is active, the Selection tool selects and moves
areas in the image. Many commands behave differently when a selection
is active. For example, the "Crop" command will crop the image to the
selection if there is one, otherwise the command will perform an
\ref(auto_crop,auto crop).

*Settings*
||\graphic(choice-transparent.png)|| Transparent background: The selected background color will not be transferred when the selection is moved. ||
||\graphic(choice-opaque.png)|| Opaque background: The selected area will be transferred with all colors. The "hole" left behind a moved selection will receive the current background color.||
||\graphic(alpha-blending.png)|| Alpha blending: When enabled, colors in the selection will blend with the background. When disabled, the colors from the selection will be copied as is to the background, including the alpha value. ||

*Keyboard modifiers*
||\image(key-ctrl.png)|| If Ctrl is held when a selection is dragged, the selection will be copied. ||
||\image(key-shift.png)|| If shift is held when a selection is dragged, the drag will be constrained to horizontal or vertical lines. ||

||\image(icon-info.png)|| Use Ctrl+Right-Click inside the selection to quickly pick a color to treat as transparent. Ctrl+Right-Click outside to select Opaque background. ||
|| || See \ref(feat-dwim-delete.txt) for a quick way to clear an area with the surrounding color ||

== Object selection ==
label:tool_object_selection
When the object layer is active, the Selection tool is used to select,
move, resize, rotate and otherwise adjust objects.

To select an object, click inside it. To deselect all objects, click
outside. Hold Ctrl to select multiple objects, or click
outside objects, hold the mouse and drag to select all objects within
a rectangle.

*Settings*\br
||\image(objselectsettings.png)|| The Object Selection tool makes the settings of all selected objects editable.\brWhen a setting is changed, the selected objects will be adjusted. Note that the current drawing settings will remain unchanged.||
||\graphic(edit-points.png)|| When an object with editable points is selected, this setting toggles between point editing and resizing. ||

*Keyboard modifiers*
||\image(key-ctrl.png)|| If Ctrl is held when the selected objects are dragged, the objects will be copied instead of moved.\brIf Ctrl is held when starting a resize, the object will be rotated instead.||
||\image(key-shift.png)||When dragging objects, Shift constrains the drag to horizontal and vertical lines.\brWhen resizing, Shift keeps the object proportions.\brWhen rotating, Shift constrains to certain angles.||
