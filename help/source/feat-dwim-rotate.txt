= Do-What-I-Mean Rotate =
The DWIM-rotate feature uses the old image edge color as background
for new region after rotating the image.

== Method ==
After rotating the image using the \ref(gui-rotate-dialog.txt), use
* Python: withbind:dwim();

== Details ==
When rotating an image by non-90-degree increments, the image area
must be grown to fit the rotated content. The new regions are normally
filled with the current secondary color.\br
\image(feat-dwim-rotate.png)

The Rotate DWIM feature allows filling the new regions with the old
edge color after rotating. This is more convenient than changing the
secondary color and then rotating. The color used as the alternative
will be the most frequently appearing color along the edges of the
rotated region.

== Example ==
An image with black background is rotated:
|| \image(feat-dwim-rotate-1.png) ||

The new regions are initially filled with the secondary color:
|| \image(feat-dwim-rotate-2.png) ||

Pressing Alt+Y triggers DWIM-rotate and changes the color to the old
edge color:
|| \image(feat-dwim-rotate-3.png) ||
