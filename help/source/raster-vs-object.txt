Faint has two modes: the 'Raster mode', for drawing and the 'Object mode' (or
'Vector mode') for adding objects.
A Faint image can mix elements from both modes. By default, raster
graphics are at the bottom and object graphics are placed on top.

The current mode determines the output created by
\ref(tools.txt,tools) - adjustable objects or static drawn pixels. The
mode is selected with the 'Layer selection control' at the top of the
tool panel\br

Working in the 'Raster mode' is a bit like regular drawing - that which has been
drawn can be erased or drawn over but not easily adjusted. The Raster mode is suitable for sketching, pixel-art and photo-editing.\br

To continue with silly analogies, working in the object mode is like
scrap-booking. Anything drawn in object mode mode becomes a vector
object that can be selected, moved and scaled. These objects can,
however, not be manipulated on the pixel-level, therefore vector
graphics are practical for diagrams (floor plans, flow-charts), and
some types of drawings - but not for e.g. photographs or pixel art.\br

When saving an image with object graphics, a vector file format, such
as SVG, should be used so the objects are preserved. Raster
file formats flatten the image. (See \ref(formats.txt)).

The combination of object and raster graphics makes it possible to add
adjustable annotations such as text and arrows to raster images.\br

and the 'Object layer' for the text and arrows.
