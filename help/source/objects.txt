= Objects =
Many \ref(tools.txt,tools) create objects when they're used in the object
mode. As an example, the \ref(tool-line.txt,line tool) adds adjustable lines in the object mode.

To work with objects, select the object mode:\br

|| \image(icon-info.png) || When using objects, it is often best to save the image in a vector \ref(formats.txt,format). ||

== Selecting objects ==
Objects can be adjusted while they are selected. There are several
ways to select objects.\br Edit->Select All (Ctrl+A) selects all
objects in the image (if the Object mode is active).

The \graphic(tool-selection.png) \ref(tool-selection.txt,selection tool)
either draws a rectangle to select all objects within, or selects
individual clicked objects when the object layer is selected.

If Ctrl is held, the clicked objects, or objects within the drawn
rectangle, will be deselected.

For more object selection details, see
\ref(feat-object-selection.txt,Feature Reference/Object Selection).

== Object settings/appearance ==
When the selection tool is used with the Object layer, changes to
settings will affect the selected objects, instead of the tools.\br

== Point editing ==
Lines, polygons and paths are constructed from multiple points which
can be adjusted independently. Ellipses also have adjustable points
used to limit them to arc segments. To edit the points of such an
object, select it with the selection tool and enable 'Edit
points'.

== Naming objects ==
label:naming_objects
Objects can be given names which can be used to refer to their
properties from \ref(ref-text-expressions.txt,text expressions) in
text objects.

To name an object, select it with the selection tool then
press enter and type a name, followed by enter again.
