Faint has a number of rotation options:

The \ref(gui-rotate-dialog.txt,rotate dialog) allows rotating the entire image,
selected objects or a raster selection.\br

The \ref(tool-selection.txt,selection tool) allows free-hand rotation
of selected objects.\br

The \ref(tool-level.txt,level tool) rotates the image to align a feature
with a defined horizon.\br

The Python function withbind:context_rotate_90CW(); rotates the image or
selection 90-degrees clockwise.

Objects can be rotated with the Python-methods rotate or set_angle on
the \ref(py-something.txt,Something class). They can also be transformed
by replacing their \ref(py-tri.txt).
