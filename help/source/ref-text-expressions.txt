= Text expressions =
This page lists all expressions supported by the
\ref(tool-text.txt,text tool) and text objects when parsing,
\graphic(text-parsing.png), is enabled.

The expressions are shown as entered while the text is being edited,
and are replaced by their result when editing has been completed.

== Evaluated expressions ==
The following expressions require parameters and are replaced by the result
of some look-up.

Expressions that refer to objects require an
\ref(naming_objects,object name) as the first parameter.

The expressions that require a unit support "px", or "px2" for areas.

When \ref(tool-calibrate.txt,calibrated), units with conversions to the
calibration unit may be used, e.g. m for meters or m2 for square
meters if calibrated with a metric unit (such as m, cm or mm).

||*Expression*||*Evaluates to*||
||\area(object,area_unit)||The object's area in the requested unit.||
||\perimeter(object,distance_unit)||The length of the object's perimeter  in the requested unit, for example px2.||
||\width(object,distance_unit)||The width of the object in the requested unit, defined as the length of p0->p1 of its \ref(py-tri.txt,Tri).||
||\height(object,distance_unit)||The height of the object in the requested unit, defined as  the length of p0->p2 of its \ref(py-tri.txt,Tri).||
||\u(unicode_code_point)||The unicode character specified by the code point (integer).||


== Character constants ==
The following expressions are replaced by their symbol, if supported
by the font.
