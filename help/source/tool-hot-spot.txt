The hot spot tool is used to specify the image "hot spot", which is
typically an anchor point.

Only some file formats, for example \ref(fmt-cur.txt,cur), use the hot
spot. In cursors, the hot spot indicates the targetting pixel.

When the hot spot tool is used, the current hot-spot is indicated by a
cross (or hash mark if zoomed).
