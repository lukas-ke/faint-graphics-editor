= Selected color control =
\image(color-options.png)

The selected color control shows the currently selected primary and
secondary color.

Left clicking either color in this control opens the
\ref(gui-color-selection-dialog.txt) for adjusting that color.

Right clicking opens a context menu with some options for the clicked
color.

== Appearances ==
When a raster or object selection is active, at least one color in the
control will target the selection. This is indicated by a dashed border
around the color:

||\image(gui-selected-color-selection-none.png)||Neither color targets a selection||
||\image(gui-selected-color-selection-both.png)||The colors target the foreground and background colors of selected objects||
||\image(gui-selected-color-selection-fg.png)||The primary color targets the foreground of selected objects. No object featuring a background is selected, so the secondary color is a regular color choice||
||\image(gui-selected-color-selection-bg.png)||The secondary color targets the mask color of the active raster selection.||

When objects are selected, the control shows colors from the selected
objects. A color change will in this case change the color of the
objects, and not the normal color selection. Once the objects are
deselected, the control will again show the regular primary and
secondary color selection used for drawing tools.

When a raster selection is active, the secondary color controls the
mask. Changes to the secondary color will in this case change the mask
of the current selection instead of the normal color selection. After
deselection or changing to a regular tool, the control will again show
the regular secondary color.
