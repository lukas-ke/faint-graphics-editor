The level tool is used to straighten rotated images, or to align
multiple images. The level tool is selected in the
\ref(gui-rotate-dialog.txt).

\image(tool-level-1.png) \image(tool-level-2.png)

To straighten a rotated image, draw a line along an edge. The image
is rotated so that the traced edge becomes horizontal.

To align a feature across multiple images, first right-click and draw
a line along a feature in the first image, then left-click and draw a
line in the second image. \br
The second image will be rotated so that the traced feature has the
same angle in both images.

*Modifiers*
||\image(mouse-left.png)||Rotate the image so that the traced line is aligned with the horizon ||
||\image(mouse-right.png)||Draw a line which redefines the horizon||
||\image(key-shift.png)||The image will be both scaled and rotated so that the traced line is aligned with the defined horizon\br(This requires defining a horizon first).||
