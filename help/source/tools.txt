summary:"The tools available for drawing in Faint"
= Tools =
The \ref(gui-tool-panel.txt,tool panel) to the left of the main frame
contains the tools that are used to draw, or add objects to-, the
drawing area.

Most tools are available in both the raster and object \ref(raster-vs-object.txt,modes).\br
To select a tool, click its button in the tool panel. Most tools do
their thing when either mouse button is held with the cursor over the
drawing area and the mouse is moved.

Many of the tools use a primary and a secondary \ref(color.txt,color). If the
left mouse button is used for drawing, the primary color will be used
for foreground and the secondary for background.
