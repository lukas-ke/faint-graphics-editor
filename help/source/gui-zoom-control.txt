|| When at 1:1 zoom, the zoom control has a fit option || When zoomed, fit is replaced by zoom to 1:1 || When zoomed out, the scale is expressed in percent ||

||\image(key-ctrl.png)||When control is held, the buttons in the zoom control will target all images, as follows:||

||Ctrl-Zoom in||+||zooms in one step in the active image, and copies that zoom to all images||
||Ctrl-Zoom out||-||zooms out one step in the active image and copies that zoom to all images||
||Ctrl-Zoom 1:1||*||zooms all images to 1:1||
||Ctrl-Zoom Fit||*||zooms all images to fit, if possible||
