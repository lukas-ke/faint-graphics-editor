= Scripting =
Faint has an interactive interpreter for the Python programming
language. This help section introduces the scripting, for a function and
class reference, see instead \ref(ref-scripting.txt).

To show the interpreter window, select '''Python Interpreter''' in the Edit menu (or press F8).
From this interpreter, most of what can be be done manually in Faint can be done
programatically.

|| \image(icon-info.png) || This documentation only covers Python as it relates to Faint. For an introduction to Python, see \extref(http://www.python.org). ||

Two simple examples on drawing from the interpreter and customizing
settings follow.

---
'Draw a 640x480 grid of 10x10 squares to the active image'\br

\py_example(scripting_intro_squares.py)
---
Typing the above code in the interpreter produces a grid of 10x10 pixel squares covering (0,0)-(640,480) in the
active drawing area.

The interpreter also allows customizing and extending Faint to make it
more effective for your work. The example below shows how a keyboard
key can be connected to several actions:
---
'Make space-bar select the line tool, set line width to 10 and foreground color to blue'\br

\py_example(scripting_intro_bind.py)
---
See \ref(python-bind-keys.txt) for more information on key binding.

= Persistent changes - the configuration file =
Functions and binds entered in the interpreter are lost when Faint is
closed. For persistence, use the \ref(feat-config-file.txt,configuration file).
