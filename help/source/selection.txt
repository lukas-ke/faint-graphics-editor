Faint has two types of selection: 'raster-' and 'object'-selection.

The raster selection selects a region in the raster graphics, while
object selection deals with complete objects. Some operations are only
available when a selection is active. For example, 'Delete' will
replace the selected raster area in the image with the background
color or, for object selection, remove all selected objects.

To modify the raster selection, use the
\ref(tool-selection.txt,selection tool) in the Raster layer. To modify the
object selection, use it in the Object layer.

The raster selection is used to move, delete and copy parts of the
raster image.  The object selection is likewise used to move, delete
and copy objects. The object selection also allows changing properties
of the selected objects, such as line width or color.
