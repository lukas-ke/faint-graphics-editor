= Drawing a flag =
This tutorial teaches the following:
* using line and rectangle objects
* snapping lines to certain points
* modifying tools with Shift and Ctrl
* editing objects

This is the first tutorial for Faint. It will take less than five
minutes to complete. If you make a mistake at any step, you can use
Undo (Ctrl+Z) to revert it.

== 1. Select the object layer ==
For this tutorial, use the object layer. To select the object layer,
click this image in the top left:

\image(select-vector.png)
== 2. Draw the flag base ==
Select the rectangle tool.\br
Change the Rectangle fill setting to "Fill-only".\br
Select a blue:ish color in the palette.\br
Click in the canvas and drag so that you create a rectangle, as shown below.\br

If you are unhappy with your rectangle, select it with the Object
selection tool, and adjust the edges.

== 3. Draw a cross ==
*...the first line*\br
Select the line tool. Use the default settings (1 pixel line width, solid line).\br
Draw a line somewhere near the flag, then select the Object select
tool to select the line and adjust it.

Try to adjust the line ends so that the line stretches vertically
through the center of the flag rectangle.

*...clone the line*\br
Now for the other line. To avoid having to re-select the line tool,
with the object selection tool still active click someowhere on the
current line. Hold Ctrl and click and drag the line, it will be cloned.

Drag and snap the ends of the new line in place across the vertical
center of the flag base, like you did before.

== 4. Thicker lines ==
The lines look a bit thin! Select both lines by clicking each line
while holding Ctrl. When both lines are selected, adjust the line
width setting. This will only change the width of selected objects.

== 5. Move the vertical line to the left ==
The finishing touch: the vertical line should be adjusted to the
left. Select the vertical line. Now hold shift. Shift enables you to
constrain the movement to either vertical or horizontal lines.  While
holding shift, move the line to the left. Notice how it stays in the
same vertical position.

== 6. Group the flag into a single object ==
Press Ctrl+A. This will select all objects. Then, Ctrl+G to group them.
The flag will now behave as a single object (to ungroup it, use the opposite command, Ctrl+U).

== 7. Save your work ==
Since we've only used object graphics, we will save the image as an svg file. Press Ctrl+S.

suitable in this tutorial
