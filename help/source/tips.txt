*Use cloning instead of copying*\br
Hold Ctrl while dragging to clone the selected raster area or selected
objects. This is in most cases more convenient than using Copy and
Paste

*Use Shift for constrained drawing*\br
Shift can be used to constrain a lot of actions horizontally,
vertically or diagonally. For example lines can be constrained to 45
degree angles and movement of the selection can be constrained along
the horizontal or vertical axes only.\br

*Use Center all the time*\br
Center (Keyboard shorcut "c") centers the image on the cursor. This is more amazing than you
might assume.

*Use Ctrl+Right-Click to set Transparent background*\br
Hold control and right click in a dragged selection to set the clicked
pixel as the \ref(feat-transparent-selection-bg.txt,transparent background) of the area. Ctrl+right click outside the
selection to use no transparent background.
