= Windows icon (.ico) =
A format for application icons on Microsoft Windows.  An icon consists
of one or more images of different size and color depth to provide
variants for different situations. The width and height of icons is
limited to 256 pixels.

The icon format is very similar to the
\ref(fmt-cur.txt,cursor format).

== Transparency ==
Icons use a mask color for transparency. When saved from Faint, fully
transparent pixels (alpha=0) will be transparent.
Semi-transparent-pixels (alpha=1-254) lose their alpha component,
becoming fully opaque.
