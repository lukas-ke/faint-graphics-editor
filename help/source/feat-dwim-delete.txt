summary:"A quick way to clear a raster area with the surrounding color"

= Do-What-I-Mean Delete =
The DWIM-delete feature replaces the hole left behind deleted raster
graphics with the surrounding color instead of the active secondary
color.

== Method ==
After performing a delete, use
* Python: withbind:dwim();

== Details ==
Normally when deleting raster graphics in the raster selection, the
"hole" is filled with the secondary color. When deleting a distinct
area surrounded by some color, it could be expected that the
surrounding color should be used instead. Since it is easy to forget
to change the background color, and tedious to undo the mistake,
change color and delete again, this feature was added.

== Example ==
||\image(dwim-delete1.png)||
||A stick man is being chased by a scary dog.||

||\image(dwim-delete2.png)||
||Eager to help, we decide to delete the dog using the raster selection tool.||

||\image(dwim-delete3.png)||
||That's typical, we used the wrong background color!||

||\image(dwim-delete4.png)||
|| DWIM-delete to the rescue. Using withbind:dwim(); we're rid of both the dog and the green rectangle ||
