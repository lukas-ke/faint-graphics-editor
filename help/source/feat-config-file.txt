= Configuration file =
A user-specific python script file, .faint.py,
is executed when Faint starts. This allows storing custom functions
and key binds.  The location of the configuration file varies with
operating systems.

This is the path to your configuration file:\br
\pyconfigpath

The \ref(gui-python-console.txt), when first opened, also displays the
location of the used configuration file.

If no configuration file exists in the expected location when Faint is
started, a default configuration file is created.
