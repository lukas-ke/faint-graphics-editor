= FrameProps =
\image(py-modifies-state.png)

FrameProps instances are used in load-functions that have been added
with \ref(python-custom-format.txt,add_format) when loading a file
type matching that format.

FrameProps objects are created with the
add_frame-method of \ref(py-image-props.txt,ImageProps) objects, and are used to load frames (or images). The pixel
and object data for a frame can be modified using the FrameProps.
