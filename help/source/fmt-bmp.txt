= Bitmap (.bmp) =
The BMP file format is an uncompressed raster format. Faint can save
either 24 bit-per-pixel bitmaps, or 8-bit-per-pixel color or grayscale
bitmaps (available as different options in the file dialog).

Bitmaps often have unduly large file sizes, so for drawings,
\ref(fmt-png.txt,PNG) is usually a better alternative. For
photographs, depending on quality requirements, \ref(fmt-jpg.txt,JPG)
may be a better alternative.

Bitmaps do not support transparency.

== 256 color bitmap (8bpp) ==
When saving as an 8-bit per pixel bitmap, the saved image will be
\ref(feat-quantize.txt,quantized) if it uses more than 256 distinct
colors.

== Grayscale bitmap (8bpp) ==
When saving as an 8-bit per pixel grayscale bitmap,the saved image is
desaturated using unweighted desaturation. If weighted desaturation is
required, the image should be desaturated manually first (see
\ref(feat-desaturate.txt)).
