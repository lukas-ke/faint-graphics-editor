= Graphics Interchange Format (.gif) =
A lossless raster format with animation support.

The number of colors per frame is limited to 256, so GIF is suitable
for simple sprites, or clipart - not photographs. When animation is
not required, \ref(fmt-png.txt,PNG) is generally a better alternative.

|| \image(icon-work-in-progress.png) || *Note*: The quantization (color reduction) Faint uses when saving a GIF is rather bad, only the first frame delay is used and transparency is lost. ||

== Transparency ==
GIF frames use a mask color for transparency. Faint only supports this
when opening. Saved gifs currently lose transparency.

== Frame delay ==
The frame delay for an image to be saved as a GIF can currently only
be set from the Python interpreter.

*Image method*
|| frame.set_delay(delay) || Sets the delay for the frame to 'delay', specified in hundredths of a second (see \ref(py-frame.txt).) ||
