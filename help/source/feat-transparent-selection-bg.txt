== Method ==
*Normal (boring) method:* Use the raster selection tool. Enable
Transparent Background. Select the color to make transparent as the
secondary color by right clicking in the palette.

*Quick method:* Use Ctrl+Right-Click inside the raster selection to
quickly pick a color to treat as transparent. Ctrl+Right-Click
outside to select Opaque background.

== Example ==

|| *1* A fancy car is selected. ||
