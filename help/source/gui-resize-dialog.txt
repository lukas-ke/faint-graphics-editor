summary:"The resize dialog for the image, objects or selection"

= The resize dialog =
The resize dialog is used for scaling, cropping and expanding. The
dialog can be used for the entire image, a selected raster region or
selected objects. The available functionality depends on the active
selection.

To open the resize dialog use Image->Resize... (Ctrl+E) or the Python function withbind:dialog_resize();

||\image(icon-info.png)||The width and height fields allow math, \ref(math_entry_fields,try it out!)||

|| *Element* || *Quick key* || *Description* ||
|| Proportional || P || When enabled and the width or the height is changed, the opposite parameter is updated to keep the relation intact. ||
|| Nearest neighbour || N || When enabled, scale operations will use nearest neighbour interpolation (no smoothing). ||
|| Width || Alt+W || For specifying the new width (in pixels). ||
|| Height || Alt+H || For specifying the new height (in pixels). ||
|| Resize anchor top left || Q || Expands or shrinks the image from the right and down and closes the dialog. ||
|| Resize anchor center || W || Expands or shrinks the image distributed over all sides and closes the dialog. ||
|| Rescale || E || Scales the image and closes the dialog. ||

== Resize/Rescale entire image ==
When no selection is active, the resize dialog will affect the
entire image.

== Math entry fields ==
label:math_entry_fields
The width and height entry fields support simple math expressions and specifying percentages. Some examples:
|| *Expression* || *Meaning* ||
||600 + 10||The width or height will be set to 610||
||600 + 10 * 4||The width or height will be set to 640||
||600 / 2||The width or height will be set to 300||
||75%||The width or height will be set to 75% of the previous value||

||\image(icon-info.png)||To add a border to an image, select the desired border color as background, open the resize dialog and set the width and height to their current values plus an offset, e.g. 640 + 20, 480 + 20, then select Resize anchor center ('W'). ||

== Copy width and height ==
The size configured in one resize dialog can be copied for use in another.
To copy both the width and height in the resize dialog, use Alt+C. To paste
the copied width and height into a resize dialog use Alt+V.

||\image(icon-info.png)||Any string with two integers separated by a comma that has been copied to the clipboard can be pasted into a resize dialog.||
