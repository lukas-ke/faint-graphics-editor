The Settings class represents tool or object \ref(settings.txt,settings.)

Note that Settings-objects are self contained (copies), they do not
keep a reference to their source, so to effect a change in Faint, the
modified settings must be passed to a function or method.

To change the settings of a Faint-object, use the update_settings
method of the \ref(py-something.txt). To use it for the current
settings in Faint (i.e. for tools), use the global update_settings function.
