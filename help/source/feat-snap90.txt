= Snap to 90-degree points =
Points in polylines and polygons can be snapped to form a 90-degree corner together with the neighbouring points.

||A polygon.||That polygon, with a vertex snapped to\br a 90-degree point||

== Method ==
||\image(key-ctrl.png)||Hold Ctrl while moving a point in a selected object. Move the point within snap-range of a corner formed by the moved point and its neighbours.||

== Example ==

||A line objects connects two rectangles:||
