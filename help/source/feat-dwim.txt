summary:"Modifies performed commands in predictable ways"

= Do-What-I-Mean (DWIM) =
Faint allows modifying some commands after they've been performed,
this is referred to as Do-What-I-Mean (DWIM).

For example, when deleting a raster region, the DWIM-feature allows
using the surrounding color rather than the secondary color. For
Auto-crop (in ambiguous situations), DWIM allows toggling which
region is cropped to. The DWIM for delete is purely for convenience,
while the auto-crop DWIM extends the utility of auto crop.

DWIM is used after a command has been executed, and is triggered
manually, using\br
withbind:dwim();

A DWIM-command can be undone and redone like other commands.
