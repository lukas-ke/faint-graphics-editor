= The frame control =

animation frames (for \ref(fmt-gif.txt,gifs)),
alternate images (for \ref(fmt-ico.txt,icons))
or pages (for \ref(fmt-pdf.txt,pdfs)).

The frame list to the right of the add-frame button is only shown if there are
at least two frames.

The Faint main view shows, and allows editing, the currently selected
frame. The selected frame is indicated in the frame list.

Frames in the list can be rearranged by drag and drop. The currently
shown frame can be removed by clicking its close icon (\graphic(close-frame.png)).

Frames are selected by clicking on them in the frame list, or using the Python-functions withbind:next_frame();, withbind:prev_frame(); or select_frame(num);
