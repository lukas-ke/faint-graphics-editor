= Frame =
\image(py-modifies-state.png)

Frame objects are used to modify a specific frame in an image. They can be retrieved from a \ref(py-canvas.txt).

||\image(icon-info.png)|| The undo/redo overhead for each action makes the Frame interface unsuitable for per-pixel modification. See instead \ref(py-bitmap.txt). ||

Frame objects only provide information and drawing operations for the
specific frame. For the operations shared between all frames in an
image, such as undo or getting the file name, see instead
\ref(py-canvas.txt).

== Example use ==
\py_example(py_frame_example.py)
