= Windows cursor (.cur) =
A format for application cursors on Microsoft Windows. A cursor
consists of one or more images of different size and color depths to
provide variants for different situations. The width and height of
cursors is limited to 256 pixels.

== Transparency ==
Cursors use a mask color for transparency. When saved from Faint,
fully transparent pixels (alpha=0) will be transparent.
Semi-transparent-pixels (alpha=1-254) lose their alpha component,
becoming fully opaque (alpha=255).

== Hot spot ==
Cursor files have a hot spot which specifies which point should anchor
at the pointer coordinate.

In Faint, the hot spot for an image can be set with the
\ref(tool-hot-spot.txt,hot spot tool) or the Python function
frame.set_hotspot (see \ref(py-frame.txt)).
