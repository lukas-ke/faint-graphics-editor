= Portable Document Format (.pdf) =
PDF is a document format with vector graphics.

Faint has limited PDF support, which can be used to save graphics for
inclusion in PDF-documents generated with for example pdflatex. In
other situations, \ref(fmt-svg.txt,SVG) is preferable when saving
vector images from Faint.

Faint can open the PDF:s it has saved, but not PDF:s from other
applications.
