= The image resize handles =
The image resize handles are used to scale the image or resize
the drawing area.

||\image(gui-image-resize-handles.png)||
|| The resize handles, with the pointer\br over the top-left handle (diagonal resizing) ||

To resize or rescale, click one of the handles, keep the mouse button
depressed and drag the mouse.

Use the left button to *resize* (expand or shrink) the drawing
area. The secondary color will fill the expanded region. Hold shift to
resize proportionally.

To *scale* the image contents, use the right mouse button. Hold down
shift for proportional resize. Hold down control to use nearest
neighbour scaling (disables color blending).

||\image(mouse-left.png)|| Resize the drawing area ||
||\image(mouse-right.png)|| Scale the image ||
||\image(key-ctrl.png)|| Nearest neighbour (scaling only) ||
||\image(key-shift.png) || Keep proportions ||

||\image(icon-info.png)|| If you need precision when resizing the drawing area, zoom in and use centering (key: 'C') to move around while resizing. ||

== DWIM resize ==
Use \ref(feat-dwim-resize.txt,DWIM) bind:dwim; after expanding the drawing
area to expand with the most prominent edge color, instead of the secondary color.
