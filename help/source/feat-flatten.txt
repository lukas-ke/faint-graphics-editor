tablewidths:*
|| *Menu* || Objects->Flatten (Ctrl+Space)||Flattens the selected objects, or all objects if there's no selection. ||
|| *Python* || flatten('objects') || Flattens the specified objects. ||

== Notes ==
When saving to a raster format, objects will, by necessity, be flattened automatically in the saved image.
